# catKlick: The most innovative Cat Photo Uploader Web App of the Decade.

A project based on cat photos and machine learning. Allows users to upload an image of their cat and utilizes google cloud to compare the image to thousands of aesthetic/unaesthetic cat images and uses that data set to predict the user engagement that would occur if the image was uploaded on Instagram. 

This is a proof of concept and could easily be scaled. This could be expanded to include a free and unlimited option for daily uploads. The unlimited option could charge an arbritrary amount, e.g. 5 dollars, with part of that going to nonprofits that help the environment/reduce carbon impact. 

This project does not necessarily have to be restricted to just cat photos, the scope could be shifted to focus on people such as influencers, or be modified to suit company interests as far as marketing is concerned.
